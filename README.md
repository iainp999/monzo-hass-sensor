# monzo-hass-sensor
A monzo sensor for Home Assistant. Currently this can be used to show your current balance as a sensor.

## Installation

To install this component into HASS copy the monzo.py file into a folder called /custom_components/sensor/ in your config directory (typically ~/.homeassistant), then add the following config:

```
sensor:
  - platform: monzo
    client_id: '***CLIENT ID***'
    client_secret: '***SECRET***'
    name: 'Optional name for the sensor'
    cache_path: '/.homeassistant/.optional-cache-location-for-token'
    current_account: true # only if you the current account
```

Set current_account true only if you have the Monzo current account.

To get a client ID, and secret go to https://developers.monzo.com/apps/home and click "+ New OAuth Client". Ensure you have set the confidentiality to "Confidential", and set the redirect url to http://ip-of-hass:8123/api/monzo

If you want to use the sensor with multiple accounts ensure you have added all the users to the "collaborators" in the OAuth client registration with monzo, and configure a differant location for the cache_path in hass.

## Known Issues:
If you have issues logging into monzo as part of the linking to open hab check the redirect part of the query string (in the address bar) matches the oAuth client you setup on monzo. Often this just looks like the "submit" button isn't working.

After logging in to Monzo by clicking on the email your browser will download a 0 byte file called "monzo". You do not need this and it's safe to delete it.

Let me know how you get on!
